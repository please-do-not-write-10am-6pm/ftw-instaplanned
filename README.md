## Functionality

### Personal Service and Venue Booking

This will be primary type of listing and is Location Specific, Scheduling-based, and with Packaged
Pricing. In this flow customer is able to book venues, photography, videography, catering, DJ
services etc - that are performed at a specific location, at a specific time. Location and provider
availability are critical components in this flow.

### On Demand / Virtual Services

These services do not require scheduling since customer and provider do not have to meet - and are
performed virtually and delivered digitally. This could include graphic designing, photo / video
editing, stationary design etc.

### User Journey

There are three distinct user journeys in the platform:

- Search: Search happens when customers search for listings on the marketplace using some
  combination of keywords, availability, filters, and sorting.

- Listing creation: Listings are created by providers to promote a product or service they are
  offering. What information providers enter into a listing, such a price or category, is usually
  the basis for the customerâ€™s search experience.

- Transactions: The transaction process determines how a customer and providers interact on the
  marketplace.
