## Functionality

### Personal Service and Venue Booking

This will be primary type of listing and is Location Specific, Scheduling-based, and with Packaged
Pricing. In this flow customer is able to book venues, photography, videography, catering, DJ
services etc - that are performed at a specific location, at a specific time. Location and provider
availability are critical components in this flow.

### On Demand / Virtual Services

These services do not require scheduling since customer and provider do not have to meet - and are
performed virtually and delivered digitally. This could include graphic designing, photo / video
editing, stationary design etc.

### User Journey

There are three distinct user journeys in the platform:

- Search: Search happens when customers search for listings on the marketplace using some
  combination of keywords, availability, filters, and sorting.

- Listing creation: Listings are created by providers to promote a product or service they are
  offering. What information providers enter into a listing, such a price or category, is usually
  the basis for the customerâ€™s search experience.

- Transactions: The transaction process determines how a customer and providers interact on the
  marketplace.

## How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/instaplanned/ftw-instaplanned.git # clone this repository
cd ftw-instaplanned/                                           # change to the cloned directory
yarn install                                                   # install dependencies
yarn run config                                                # add the mandatory env vars to your local config.
yarn run dev                                                   # start the dev server, this will open a browser in localhost:3000
```
### For Windows users

Change `export` to `set` in the package.json file if you're using Windows/DOS. You need to do the
change to "dev" and "dev-sever" commands.

```
"dev": "yarn run config-check&&set NODE_ENV=development&& set REACT_APP_DEV_API_SERVER_PORT=3500&&concurrently --kill-others \"yarn run dev-frontend\" \"yarn run dev-backend\""
```

```
"dev-server": "set NODE_ENV=development&& set PORT=4000&& set REACT_APP_CANONICAL_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:4000&&yarn run build&&nodemon --watch server server/index.js"
```

We strongly recommend installing
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), if you are
developing on Windows. These templates are made for Unix-like web services which is the most common
environment type on host-services for web apps. Also, Flex Docs uses Unix-like commands in articles
instead of DOS commands.
